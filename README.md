# breakfast_machine - Random Magic Item Generator for Way of Steel

breakfast_machine automates the creation of Way of Steel magic items (including weapons, armor, and shields) with randomly chosen names and their respective properties. It produces files ready to be consumed by a game card layout program such as nanDECK. 

Filter options allow the WoS GM to tailor the results to fit party composition, campaign mood, and setting. 

Pressed for time? Run it out of the box with the pre-loaded pool of powers and base items. 

Fastidious? Easily add, remove, or edit pool elements.

The application is platform-agnostic and should work on any laptop or desktop that meets the given prerequisites.

(It doesn't make breakfast at all.)

TBD. I'll have this sorted out by the time it is usable. First, I gotta get my law degree and read roughly 4.2 billion different licenses.
